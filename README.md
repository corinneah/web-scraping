# web-scraping Assignment 7

2. Using BS4, find at least 2 websites that you want to scrap data from - provide that code within a .py file  

3. In the code, for each website - create at least one dataframe that has structured data 

4. Save each of the dataframes as separate .csv files into a "/data" folder within your repo - be sure to include the .csv files within your repo (make sure they are small, < 25mb)
